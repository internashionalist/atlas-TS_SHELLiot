## Synopsis
```sh
This project creates a simple Unix-like shell program, codenamed T.S. SHELLiot (Thames-Sexton Shell), taking in user input and executing the given commands.
```

## Description
```sh
T.S. SHELLiot implements a simple command-line shell that mimics basic Unix shell functionality. It continuously displays a prompt ($) and allows users to execute commands by typing them into the terminal. The shell can handle interactive and non-interactive modes, parsing user input and executing commands using execve. It also gracefully handles end-of-file (EOF) signals and displays appropriate error messages for invalid commands.
```
